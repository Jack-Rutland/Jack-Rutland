# Hey! I'm Jack 👋

## 🤠 About Me

🎓 I am a Junior CS major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I was a firm believer that I would hate CS theory coming out of high school, but it has been growing on me more and more with every class I take. I should be graduating mid-2023.

👨‍💻 I started getting into web development freshman year of college because of a hackathon I was participating in, and have been in love with it ever since. However, my root will always be with Python. As such, my languages of choice are **Javascript** and **Python**, depending on the task. I also have a huge interest in the fields of **Extended Reality**, **Cryptography** (specifically dapps), and **Artificial Intelligence** (this is also my concentration).

💪 My biggest hobbies outside of software development are powerlifting and bodybuilding. While I haven't competed in an event since high school, I still enjoy pursuing my journey of finding my own body's limitations.

### 🧠 Long Term Goals

-   **Make education more accessible to kids K-12** : I strongly believe that no kid is born without a "brain for STEM". The beauty of STEM fields is that there are a million ways to arrive at the right answer, so why are we still trying to teach in such a cookie cutter layout? 
-   **Contribute to making humans interplanetary** : I have always loved space since I was a kid, and I grew up during the period SpaceX began making space popular again for the first time since 1969. I would like to be able to solve unique challenges that arise as we reach for the stars.
-   **Help with climate change reversal** : At the rate we are moving now, climate change *prevention* is going to be too little too late. Down the road, it is on us to repair the harm we have done to the atmosphere to make the world a place we would want our kids and generations onward to live in.
